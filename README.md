# XYZ-Reader

This is a project for Android Developer Nanodegree program. I was given a functional app which was not well designed. Basing on user feedbacks, I redesigned the app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app. 

## What I Learned

* Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
* Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
* Separate an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively use transitions and motion.
